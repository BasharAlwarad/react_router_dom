steps to teach React-router-dom:
- using basic commenting out components to show different options on the screen.
- explain how the server works with vanilla JS example.
- explain how the API works.
-show the react-components dev-tool in the browser and from there the structure of the app
-Navigation.provider and location.provider uses the Context apt internally. context api is a state manager.
-introduction to JSX.
-create variable give it a value of div and return it in App component.
-Link tag will call the render function without refreshing the page.
-explain router with id.
-I'll recommend to stick to the react router for now, because you need to be comfortable using many other concepts like useContext, async-operations, and suspended-components. 

-Routes and Route
